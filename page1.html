                                Lourdes College had its humble beginning as a San Agustin Parochial School for elementary boys and girls, founded in 1928 by the late Archbishop James Hayes, S. J. In 1933, the school produced its first twenty (20) graduates in the elementary grades. To respond to a growing need for a high school Catholic education in the city, the school operated with separate principals for the boys and the girls. The girls' division saw the birth of Lourdes Academy managed by the Religious of the Virgin Mary (RVM) Sisters. Sister Ma. Andrea Montejo, RVM was the first Directress and Sister Ma. Esperanza Edralin, RVM was the first Principal. The boys' division, now Xavier University, was managed by the Jesuit priests.

                            In 1938, Lourdes Academy became Lourdes Junior College, offering Junior Normal and Home Economics Courses. On May 2, 1939, the new buildings were reduced to ashes. In 1945, the school resumed operation under the leadership of Sister Ma. Esperanza Edralin, RVM, with the untiring support of Bishop Hayes. In 1947, it was raised to the status of a College when it offered the Teacher Education Program. The school, then, became Lourdes College.

                            In 1987, a Master of Arts in Education major in Elementary Education was offered. <br><br> In 1987-88, the RVM’s commitment to preferential love for the poor gave birth to the establishment of the Mother Ignacia Social Concern Center, Inc. (MISCCI) as the school’s Official Community Service Arm. The Mother Ignacia Night High School was opened to accommodate daughters of economically deprived families and adults who work for their livelihood during the daytime. A project called Buhay: Mother Ignacia Development Project funded by MISEREOR (The German Catholic Bishops’ Organization for Development Cooperation) was established which consisted of income-generating projects, basic and adult education, and provision of a water system. It was participated in by a total of 120 households. As part of this project, the Mother Ignacia School was established in Lower Dagong, Carmen. After ten years, as in any community organizing effort, this school was turned over by Lourdes College to the empowered members of the community for them to become more independent. The school is presently managed by the Department of Education.</p>

                            In 1991, the Mother Ignacia Housing Project was instituted with the construction of subsidized core houses made of compressed earth blocks and fiber and cement tiles. This was jointly funded by MISEREOR and Lourdes College. Some 110 housing units were constructed and these benefited scavenging families. A very significant component of the project was the economic capability building like income-generating activities, adult literacy programs together with community organizing. The project that Lourdes College had with MISEREOR terminated after three years. In 1994, MISCCI, representing Mindanao, received the National Award for Community Service (NACS) from the Rotary Club of Makati and San Miguel Corporation, with a Plaque of Appreciation and a prize of P70,000.00. The project likewise became one of the showcases of the Asian Regional Consultation for Habitat. The housing project was nominated as one of the Habitat entries for Asia in April 1996.

This was to provide special college preparation to high school students who would like to pursue Science and Math allied courses. The Science Laboratory, which was completed in 1996, was provided to complement the research activities of the SSC students. In the same year, the Gymnasium was constructed to provide a venue for the co-curricular activities of the students. <br><br> The Grade School Department was awarded by the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS) as the “Most Effective Private Elementary School” in Region 10 in the school year 1993-94. Likewise, the High School Department was awarded by the DECS as the “Most Outstanding Private Secondary School” in Region 10 in 1994-95, and again in 1996-97, the High School Department was awarded as the “Most Effective Secondary School” in Region 10.

                            On February 21-22, 2005, the PAASCU team visited the High School and Grade School levels. Both were granted Level II accreditation status but the High School level was required to be subjected to an interim visit in the Instruction area after three (3) years. <br><br> On August 22-23, 2005, the Teacher Education, Liberal Arts, and Commerce were granted a Level II re-accreditation status for another five (5) years, the Hotel and Restaurant Management Program had its preliminary visit and Social Work Program was granted Level I Accreditation status. <br><br> In the school year 2005-2006, Teaching Physical Education was offered as an additional major/field of specialization in the Master of Arts in Education (MAEd). <br><br> Considering the growing number of students in the Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (BSHRM) as well as its Associate course (AHRM), the school created an academic program for this course, separating it from the Business and Accountancy Program during the second semester of School Year 2005–2006. The new structure enabled the dean to provide adequate supervision and monitoring for the development of the students and faculty.

                            To further provide facilities for the growing population of the HRM Program, the school established the HRM Training Center which was blessed on November 29, 2006. Since its operation, it has provided an avenue for students to hone their skills in hotel and restaurant operations. <br><br> In 2006, Lourdes College was designated as a Learning Center for the University of the Philippines Open University or UPOU. The Memorandum of Agreement was signed in September and after the formal assignment in October of the same year, the school began its services to the students through distance learning. The service ended in SY 2012-2013 because the contract was not renewed for the following school year. <br><br> Lourdes College graduated its first batch of Bachelor of Science in Nursing in 2006 and obtained an 83% passing percentage in the Nursing Licensure Exam held in December 2006. The Social Work Batch 2007 graduates all passed the Licensure Examination.

                            Providing support to quality instruction, the physical facilities continued to be upgraded. In 2011, renovations focused on the music room, physics and anatomy laboratories, HRM faculty room, Mini Hotel, and some offices in the main building. In the second semester of 2011-12, some classrooms were air-conditioned; the auditorium was repainted and made air-conditioned. Renovations were made in the Mother Ignacia building in the Macasandig campus because it was reduced to ashes.

                          During the school year 2014-2015, the Nursing Program resumed the acceptance of first-year students which was frozen two years before. In this same year, the Nursing, Pharmacy and Nutrition, and Dietetics programs are clustered under the Allied Health Program in the Higher Education Department. <br><br> In 2014, the following accomplishments were done in the library: 1) expansion of the learning commons Internet Zone providing more internet-connected computer units (from 14 to 27 units); 2) provision of a unique, spacious, and comfortable carrel for individual research/study with 27 seats; 3) provision of Proquest Online database; 4) coffee shop in one part of the learning commons made more functional. Such effort was rewarded by the award granted to the school’s Library as the 2014 Outstanding Academic and Research Library by the Philippine Association of Academic Research Librarians (PAARL). <br><br> Improvements done in the Basic Education Department included the offering of the Lourdes College (Mother Ignacia) Open High School to students who can work during the week since classes are only held every Saturday. Instruction was complemented using the blended approach consisting of a combination of online learning and printed modules. <br><br> In 2014-2015, the college faculty were re-oriented to the RVM Pedagogy. This serves as an innovative curricular framework to make the instructional processes aligned with the current demands of education. <br><br> In the same year, PAASCU granted Level II re-accreditation status to the Bachelor of Science in Social Work and Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management programs. The Social Work program has produced several topnotchers through the years, and in recent years, a graduate got the 10th place in 2014; and another in 2015. Based on the performance of first-time takers in the Licensure Examination from SY 2011-2014, Lourdes College got Rank 2 in the whole country in Bachelor of Science in Social Work, Rank 5 in Bachelor in Library and Information Science; Rank 9 in Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics; and Rank 13 in the Bachelor in Elementary Education among schools having less than 50 examinees (Source: Finduniversity. ph as of November 2014).

                            In February 2021, the school produced 2 top notchers (No.6 and 8) and Lourdes College was ranked number 2 top performing school nationwide in the Social Work examination. In the same SY, CHED granted recognition for the Bachelor of Culture and Arts Education (BCAED) and Bachelor of Technology and Livelihood Education (BTLED). The school was likewise recognized as a Delivering Higher Education Institution (DHEI) for the SIKAP grant of CHED. <br><br> The school was granted ISO re-certification last April 26, 2021. Furthermore, Lourdes College expanded its international efforts by forging partnerships with universities in Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and SEAMEO; by engaging in conversations with international resource experts about enhancing distance learning, research, innovations in technology and teaching through webinars that are shared with other RVM schools, public and private school teachers, and other members of the community. Students also benefited through their participation in these activities.

                            On April 28, 2022, TUV Rheinland renewed the ISO certification to Lourdes College after the first surveillance audit. Considering the health status of the community, the school slowly transitions to the new normal by offering limited face-to-face classes for laboratory subjects. Retrofitting was also done to prepare the campus for the eventual in-person limited instructional processes. <br><br> PAASCU granted re-accreditation certificates to the following programs: Master of Arts in Education (Level II), Elementary and Secondary Teacher Education; Arts and Sciences; Business Administration (Level III); and Nutrition and Dietetics (Level II) programs after their virtual visit last September 30 to October 1, 2022, and October 13–14, 2022. <br><br> In October 2022, the K-10 classes adopted the hybrid flexible learning mode with seven (7) hyflex equipment installed in their classrooms. Four (4) hyflex equipment were also provided in the graduate school and college laboratories to facilitate learning, thesis defense and webinars for both onsite and online learners. The Senior High School, college and graduate school employ the blended learning mode with specific days allotted for onsite and online learning modalities. The school was granted the second recertification by ISO after passing the second surveillance audit last May 11, 2023. Last May 18, 2023, PAASCU granted Level 3 re-accreditation certificate to the Hospitality Management Program which is valid until February, 2025. <br><br> Lourdes College continues to provide opportunities for the integral formation of the learners. The graduates are now serving in the different sectors of society – education, business and industry, government service, religious institutions, and others - in the country and foreign lands. Motivated by the Gospel values and the example of Mary and Venerable Ignacia del Espiritu Santo, this RVM Catholic school remains steadfast and zealous in its commitment to serve the community through its education ministry.
